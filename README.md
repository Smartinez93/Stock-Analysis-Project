# Stock-Analysis-Project

## Overview:
In this project I worked on editing,refactoring, code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information about the stocks. Since refactoring is a key part of the coding process. I did my best to refactor the code, by notadding new functionality; but by trying to make the code more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, and improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

## Results:
To start off I found this task of refactoring the code to be challenging to start.

## Summary:

### 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?



### 2.How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
